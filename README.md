## User Story

On the landing page, users will be greeted by a welcome message, a "view users" link and a "sign up" option in the top right hand corner of the page.

The "view users" link will redirect users to a user index page where they can view all existing users. From here they can navigate to each users show page and view the playlists that each user has created.

Clicking the "sign up" button the user will be redirected to a page where they will be prompted to create a username and password. Once they submit the form to create their account, the user will be redirected to their own user show page.



The user will be able to view a list of all of their existing playlists on this page. Clicking on a playlist will render that playlists show page where all of the songs on the playlist will be displayed. From this page, users will have the option to edit or delete a playlist.
