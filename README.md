## User Story

On the landing/home page, users will be greeted by a welcome message, a "view users" link and a "sign up" option in the top right hand corner of the page.

Clicking the "sign up" button the user will be redirected to a page where they will be prompted to create a username and password. Once they submit the form to create their account, the user will be redirected to their own user show page. 

The user will be able to view a list of all of their existing playlists on this page as well as their favorite artist. There will also be a button to edit the users information such as their password, favorite artist, and username. Clicking on a playlist will render that playlists show page where all of the songs on the playlist will be displayed. 

From the playlist show page, users will have the option to create, edit or delete a playlist by clicking on a button. The edit and create buttons will redirect to a new edit/create playlist page while the delete button will instantly remove the playlist from the users show page.

The "view users" link on the home page will redirect users to a user index page where they can view all existing users. Clicking on the name of a user will redirect you to the users show page where you will be able to view a list of all of the playlists that the user has created. By clicking on the name of a playlist, the user will be redirected to that playlists show page where they can view the songs inside of the playlist.
